# 🎾 Bouncing Logo Animation (Java Swing)  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This Java Swing project creates a **bouncing logo animation** inside a JFrame window. The animation uses a `JPanel` to move an image (`dvd.png`) dynamically, changing its direction when it hits the window's boundaries.  

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ Smooth **bouncing animation** inside a JFrame.  
- ✅ Uses **Java Swing components** (`JFrame`, `JPanel`, `JLabel`).  
- ✅ Runs in a **separate thread** for real-time movement.  
- ✅ **Collision detection** to reverse direction on window edges.
